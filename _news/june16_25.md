# Update on June 17, 2025

I've made several updates to my website:

- Updated the [CV](/cv/) with a json-based format for easier parsing and integration.
- Updated the [news](/news/) section with recent activities and achievements.
- Updated the [about](/) page to reflect my current focus on AI and cloud-native architectures

I'm also prepare a new SpinOff project about AI-driven document processing and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which will be announced soon.

This morning I registered for Red Hat ([Developer Day Rome](https://events.redhat.com/profile/form/index.cfm?PKformID=0x1466212399b)), on July 10, 2025. Looking forward to networking with fellow developers and learning about the latest in cloud-native technologies.
