I have been mainly involved in software design and developing with different programming language(Java for Enterprise Web Applications, Python for Big Data, Data Analysis and Web Applications, Dart and Flutter Framework). I have a PhD in Industrial and Information Engineering, with a thesis on Parallel compiler techniques for multi-Cloud and Big Data platforms. I have been developing primitives for a source-to-source compiler based on Python skeleton, manipulating syntactic trees, to facilitate the use of big data platforms and the implementation of analytics in the cloud.

So I got closer to the world of compilers and the big data world, but in my free time, I'm devoting myself to studying new programming languages ​​(I just started studying Go), developing mobile applications, studying neural networks, and applying to Natural Language Processing.

I'm passionate about cross-fit, functional training, running, cinema, and TV series.
I love my extended family (wife, 2 kids, 2 dogs, 3 fish), and travel with it!
