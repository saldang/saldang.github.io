Hi, I’m **Salvatore D’Angelo** – a **researcher, university lecturer, and freelance ICT consultant**.

I hold a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Engineering and have over ten years of experience in **software development, cloud-native architectures, artificial intelligence, and DevOps**.
My academic work focuses on **compilers, big data, NLP**, and **distributed systems**, while my professional activity helps companies, startups, and public institutions bring innovative, scalable digital solutions to life.

## What I Do

- **Technical consultancy**: I support organizations in designing modern, efficient software systems—from mobile apps built with Flutter to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and intelligent document processing.
- **Professional training**: I teach university and corporate courses on DevOps, Kubernetes, Terraform, OpenShift, object-oriented programming, and mobile development.
- **R&D and prototyping**: I develop AI/NLP-based systems, source-to-source compilers, AST transformation tools, and cloud-edge orchestration frameworks.

## Technologies I Work With

Python · Flutter · Dart · Kubernetes · Terraform · Streamlit · FastAPI · Ollama · ChromaDB · GitLab CI/CD · NLP · Graph DB · Compilers · AST · Docker · OpenShift

## My Vision

I believe in merging **academic rigor with practical engineering**, especially in high-impact sectors like public administration, education, and digital transformation.
My goal is to build **ethical, maintainable, and scalable software** — backed by clean architecture and a strong knowledge-transfer mindset.
